The Android operating system is a mobile operating system that was developed by Google to be primarily used for touchscreen devices, cell phones, and tablets. Its design lets users manipulate the mobile devices intuitively, with finger movements that mirror common motions, such as pinching, swiping, and tapping. Google also employs Android software in televisions, cars, and wristwatches—each of which is fitted with a unique user interface.

## Android Operating System vs. Apple iOS

The emergence of Android created a new rivalry between smartphone manufacturers, with Apple (AAPL) serving as Google's chief competitor. To some, this competitive dynamic mirrors that of the “cola wars” between Coca-Cola (KO) and Pepsi (PEP) over the past 40 years, where no clear winner or loser has emerged. Android was the most popular operating system on mobile devices as of Q1 2022, with 23.7% of the global market share while Apple's iOS was in second place with 18%, according to International Data Corporation.

The increased popularity of the system has also led to a number of patent-related lawsuits, including a lawsuit brought forth by Oracle (ORCL). In 2010, the company alleged that Google unlawfully used Java APIs to develop its Android software. In April 2021, the case was decided with the Supreme Court ruling 6-2 in Google's favor.
